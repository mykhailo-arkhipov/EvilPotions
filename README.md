#### What is this game about 
An indie game about an evil alchemist trying to create the most horrifying potions possible, but it doesn't always work out. That's why sometimes he ends up with potions that have a positive effect when he's not even trying.

#### Platform and Technologies
The primary platform is Android. The project is developed using the LibGDX framework and several official extensions to this framework. Testing is carried out using JUnit and Robot Framework. Built by Gradle. But as the game is in development, the number and types of used technologies could change.
